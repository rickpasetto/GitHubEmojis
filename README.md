# GitHubEmojis

This very simple example app loads the list of Emojis that GitHub supports (https://api.github.com/emojis) and displays them in a list.  Selecting an Emoji image will open it in a full-screen view.  This was implemented as a simple Master/Detail sample iOS application.  It is written in Swift 3.

# Prerequisites

- Xcode 8.1

# How to run

- Load GitHubEmojis/GitHubEmojis.xcodeproj in Xcode
- Run in the Simulator

# Notes

To run this on an actual iOS device, you will need to add a Apple Developer Team to code signing.
